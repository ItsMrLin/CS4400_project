# CS4400 project
100% CS4400 spring'15 project 

---

## Setup

You'll first need to make sure you have `npm` installed globally in your system.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Then open up MAMP, XAMPP, etc. and everything should work.

**Note: You might need to change the config options for the database, which I've put in `resources/config.php`. Make sure you
don't commit `config.php` to git, because it can screw everyone's custom server configurations.**
